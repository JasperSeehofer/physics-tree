# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-17)

**Core value:** Users can visually explore the interconnected landscape of physics and deeply learn any concept through interactive visualizations, derivations, quizzes, and runnable code — with gamification that makes sustained learning feel rewarding.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Foundation)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-17 — Roadmap created

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Rust + WASM (Leptos 0.8 frontend, Axum 0.8 backend) — performance for interactive simulations
- SurrealDB replaced by PostgreSQL + SQLx per research — native graph queries not needed at classical mechanics scale; recursive CTEs on PostgreSQL suffice
- Sigma.js + Graphology for WebGL graph rendering — must be committed before content is added (switching later requires full visualization rewrite)
- WASM bundle size budget: 1 MB compressed — CI fails if exceeded from first build
- Content pipeline: AI draft → human review → Approved gate — no content reaches production without explicit approval

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2] Sigma.js + Leptos integration via wasm-bindgen JS interop has limited documented examples — needs prototype spike before Phase 2 planning
- [Phase 3] Rapier2D + HTML Canvas rendering pattern inside a Leptos component needs a working prototype — address in Phase 3 planning
